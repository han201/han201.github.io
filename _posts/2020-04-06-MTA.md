title: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Example
---

* NYC MTA Data
-----

This is my first project with [Metis Data Science Bootcamp](www.thisismetis.com), demonstrating a simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using [MTA turnstile data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html). MTA publically offers entry and exit counts of every turnstile for the past 10+ years with 4 hour frequency. I used numpy and pandas as well as some Python visual tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for EDA.

## Data

MTA Turnstile Usage Data have the following information:

* C/A: Control Area name/Booth name. 
* Unit: Remote unit ID of station
* SCP: a specific address for a given device
* STATION: name assinged to the subway station. Could be same for multiple stations
* LINENAME: Train lines
* DIVISION: The original line name that the station belonged to
* DATE: the date of data


## Procedures

* Import Data
* Data Preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Conclusion


### Import Data

The easiest way is to use pandas' read_csv functionality such as :

df = pd.read_csv('http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/turnstile/turnstile_190406.txt')

Meanwhile, a clever way would be to use a funciton to read multiple data at once:

def get_data(week_nums):
    url = "http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/turnstile/turnstile_{}.txt"
    dfs = []
    for week_num in week_nums:
        file_url = url.format(week_num)
        dfs.append(pd.read_csv(file_url))
    return pd.concat(dfs)
        
week_nums = [190525, 190518, 190511, 190504, 190427, 190420, 190413, 190406]
turnstiles_df = get_data(week_nums)



### Data Preprocessing Summary

* Make sure to remove any empty space in the column name
* Use 'datetime' to read the date format correctly (also useful for 'Day of Week' conversion)
* Identify a turnstile by combining C/A, UNIT, SCP and Station columns
* Count the number of entries and exits by the day or by every 4 hours
* Identify bad data. Throw away or replace with reasonable numbers
* Consolidate by each station (use 'LINENAME' info to identify a unique station name)

### Exploratory Data Analysis

* Here is an example graph on the number of daily entries for a turnstile at 34th Herald Square Station.
It shows an interesting separation between weekdays (more than 3500 usage) and weekends (less than 3000 usage).

* Consolidate the turnstile information into a Station level information

* Here is a list of top 10 most populated stations

* I also examined the variance by the week of the day. The highest useage was from Tuesday and Thursday. Saturday and Sunday has low usages.

### Conclusion

The result is very predictable with the common sense. The most populated stations were 42 Times Squres, 42 Grand Central, 34 Herald Squres, 34 Penn Stations and Fulton Stations, etc matching the common sense.

### Future Work

My analysis is based on the daily entry data, however, it could be also interesting to repeat the analysis by the 4 hour frequency, so that we can identify the businest time of teh day. Base on data, the busiest time seems to be between 4 pm and 8 pm period.
