   Hello, this is my first blog as a way of practicing markdown and data science. This site is still under construction.   </p>

If you are interested in reaching out, pease message me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/han-lee-4824082/).

## Educational Background

Since I came to the US in 2000, I am honoured to attend two of the most prestigious schools:

* [MIT](http://www.mit.edu)
* [Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu)

It was my pleasure studying together with some of the world's best scholars and successful people. FYI, learn more about the best schools in the US [USNEWS](usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities).

## Careers

Since 2006, I have been working in the financial industry mostly in hedge funds and proprietary trading companies as follows.


* [BlackRock](http://blackrock.com): Internship. I met two life mentors through this experience, with whom I still keep in touch.
* [Amaranth Advisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranth_Advisors): The company lost $6B a few months after I joined, an epic fall in the hedge fund industry
* [Highbridge Capital](www.highbridge.com): I worked for a global macro trading desk
* [EWT/Virtu Financial](www.virtu.com): HFT trading
* [Citadel Securities](www.citadelsecurities.com): HFT trading
* Looking for the next opportunity
